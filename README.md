# music-vae
A repository containing my experiment on implementing the [Music VAE](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-vae) model to extract the 4-bars drum samples from the [MIDI dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/groove).

## Overview
- **VAE Model**: [Music VAE](https://github.com/magenta/magenta/tree/main/magenta/models/music_vae)
- **Input**: MIDI - 4-bar Dataset.
- **Process**: Train Music VAE.
- **Output**: 4-bars drum samples (MIDI).

## Environment Preparation


## Training Process
Training process is quite straightforward, steps-by-steps process has been explained in:
